								Server Work Flow - based on Jetty Web Server 9.0
										- by minglin, 2013-03-29

0. Overview
This report attempts to disclose the internal of Jetty web server. We try to illustrate how Jetty web server accept and 
process a huge number of concurrent requests from millions of clients.
But before diving into the source code of Jetty 9, we strongly recommend you to read the document "Jetty 7 Architecture" 
firstly, it will save you a lot of time in the journey of disclosing the internal of Jetty web server.
The document locates at: http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/basic-architecture.html 
When reading the document, you should pay attention that the conent of some sections in the document is out of date, 
since this document describes the architecture of Jetty 7 instead of Jetty 9. 
We point out the content as either valuable or out of date sequentially as follows for your reference:
1) Sections "View from 20,000 feet", and "Patterns" are valuable.
2) Section "Connectors" is out of date.
3) Section "Handlers", the chart of Handler hierarchy is incorrect.
4) Sections "Nested Handlers and Handlers Called Sequentially", "Servlet Handler", and "Contexts" are valuable.
5) Section "Web Application" is valuable.

1. Sample code for creating, configuring, and starting a Jetty web server
This report uses the following sample code that creates, configures, and starts a Jetty web server as a guide.
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		if(args.length != 1) {
			System.err.println("Illegal argument number!");
			System.out.println("Usage: jar target/filesyncer-http-server.jar host:port");

			return;
		}
		String address = args[0];
		int colon = address.indexOf(':');
		String host = address.substring(0, colon);
		int port = Integer.parseInt(address.substring(colon+1));
		System.out.println("server: " + host + ":" + port);

		Server server = new Server();

		SelectChannelConnector scc = new SelectChannelConnector();
		scc.setHost(host);
		scc.setPort(port);
		scc.setRequestHeaderSize(8192);
		int maxIdleTime = Integer.parseInt(HttpServerSetting.getProperty("server.idletime.max"));
		scc.setMaxIdleTime(maxIdleTime);
		int threadPoolSize = Integer.parseInt(HttpServerSetting.getProperty("server.threadpool.size"));
		scc.setThreadPool(new QueuedThreadPool(threadPoolSize));

		server.setConnectors(new Connector[]{scc});

		ServletContextHandler syncOpContext = new ServletContextHandler(ServletContextHandler.SESSIONS);
		syncOpContext.setContextPath("/");	
		syncOpContext.addServlet(new ServletHolder(new ConnectServlet()), "/index.html");
		syncOpContext.addServlet(new ServletHolder(new SyncOpServlet()), "/repos/*");
		server.setHandler(syncOpContext);

		try {
			server.start();
		}catch(Exception e) {
			System.err.println("Start server failed - " + e);
		}
		try {
			server.join();
		}catch(InterruptedException ie) {
			System.err.println("Wait for server to terminate failed - " + ie);
		}
	}

2. Sever start work flow illustrated
In this section, we illustrate what Jetty web server is doing behind the scene from a client asks to connect to the
web server and makes a request to the connection is accepted, and the corresponding method(doGet/Post/Put/Delete) 
of the servelet handler is invoked to handle the reqeust.

2.1 Call chain of Server
Server is a HandleWrapper which is an lifecycle managed Handlers container. 
    ContainerLifeCycle  Handler(interface)
	      	|	/
	AbstractHandler	   HandlerContainer(interface)
			|		/
	    AbstractHandlerContainer
			|
		HandlerWrapper
			|
	      Server

So Server.start() overrides util/component/AbstractLifeCycle.start(), which sets its state to starting, calls doStart(),
and sets its state to started. Server.doStart() calls super.doStart() and starts all the Connectors it aggregates. 
Look into the implementation of doStart() follwing the inheritance chain above, we know Server.doStart() will call 
ContainerLifeCycle.doStart() which starts all the beans added to it finally. 
And from Server code, we know the ThreadPool in "_threadPool" is added as beans. So super.start() in Server.doStart() 
starts the ThreadPool, and then starts all connectors it aggregates. The Executor "_executor" is set to the ThreadPool 
in AbstractConnector:
jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/AbstractConnector.java:
    public AbstractConnector(
            Server server,
            Executor executor,
            Scheduler scheduler,
            ByteBufferPool pool,
            int acceptors,
            ConnectionFactory... factories)
    {
        _server=server;
        _executor=executor!=null?executor:_server.getThreadPool();
        if (scheduler==null)
            scheduler=_server.getBean(Scheduler.class);
        _scheduler=scheduler!=null?scheduler:new ScheduledExecutorScheduler();
        if (pool==null)
            pool=_server.getBean(ByteBufferPool.class);
        _byteBufferPool = pool!=null?pool:new ArrayByteBufferPool();

        addBean(_server,false);
        addBean(_executor);
        if (executor==null)
            unmanage(_executor); // inherited from server
        addBean(_scheduler);
        addBean(_byteBufferPool);

        for (ConnectionFactory factory:factories)
            addConnectionFactory(factory);

        if (acceptors<=0)
            acceptors=Math.max(1,(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()) / 2);
        if (acceptors > 2 * Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors())
            LOG.warn("Acceptors should be <= 2*availableProcessors: " + this);
        _acceptors = new Thread[acceptors];
    }

And ManagedSelectors in SelectorManager are scheduled to run using the threads got from the thread pool stored in 
the Executor "_executor":
    @Override
    protected void doStart() throws Exception
    {
        super.doStart();
        for (int i = 0; i < _selectors.length; i++)
        {
            ManagedSelector selector = newSelector(i);
            _selectors[i] = selector;
            selector.start();
            execute(selector);
        }
    }
Note the ManagedSelector is a Runnable, and the ThreadPool is an Executor.
So the thread model used by the Connectors is as follows:
A Connector creates a Runnable "AbstractConnector$Acceptor" to accept each connection request and submits it to ThreadPool. 
Once a connection is accepted, a SocketChannel will be returned, SelectorManager creates a Runnable "ManagedSelector$
Accept" and submits it to one of the ManagedSelectors in the SelectorManager. While the ManagedSelectors are sheduled to 
run by using the threads got from the ThreadPool. 
We assume the machine running Jetty web server has 3 processors, then the thread model can be depicted roughly as follows:
AbstractConnector$Acceptor 1 ->
...							 ->	ThreadPool._jobs(of type ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>)	-> ThreadPool
AbstractConnector$Acceptor n ->

ManagedSelector$Accept 1	->	
...							->	ManagedSelector._changes(of type ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>)	->	ManagedSelector thread
ManagedSelector$Accept i	->

ManagedSelector$Accept j	->	
...							->	ManagedSelector._changes(of type ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>)	->	ManagedSelector thread
ManagedSelector$Accept k	->

ManagedSelector$Accept m	->	
...							->	ManagedSelector._changes(of type ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>)	->	ManagedSelector thread
ManagedSelector$Accept n    ->

ManagedSelector 1	->
ManagedSelector 2	->	ThreadPool._jobs(of type ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>)	-> ThreadPool
ManagedSelector 3	->
Note Runnable "ManagedSelector$Accept" does trivial things: register a SocketChannel with the ManagedSelector, 
create a new EndPoint, and attach it to the SelectionKey, all such Runnables are submit to a ConcurrentLinkedQueue
"_changes" in one of ManagedSelectors, and they are run in the ManagedSelector thread before each run of select().
Question: The thread model used to the process of the selected SocketChannel? 
For example, when SelectorManager$ManagedSelector.select() calls processKey(SelectionKey) to process key, is the 
read/write operations run in the ManagedSelector thread, or a new thread? Where to get such clue?

2.2 What does ServerConnector do?
2.2.1 Overview
ServerConnector creates a number of threads "AbstractConnector$Acceptor", each of which creates a ServerSocketChannel 
to accept client connection requests. Once a client connection is accepted, a SocketChannel is returned, we create a 
Runnable "Accept" for the SocketChannel and submit it as a change to one of the selectors in SelectorManager.
Each selector in SelectorManager is a ManagedSelector which calls select() repeatedly to select the SocketChannels that
are ready for some events and process them.
N.B. ServerConnector uses Executor service to run a number of Selector tasks(io/SelectorManager), the number of them 
equals to the number of processors available to the JVM by default(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()).

2.2.2 Connector class hierarchy
Connector
    |
AbstractConnector    NetworkConnector
	|		/
    AbstractNetworkConnector
	   |
     ServerConnector

AbstractConnector: an abstract implementation of Connector that provides a ConnectionFactory mechanism for creating 
Connection instances for various protocols (HTTP, SSL, SPDY, etc).
NetworkConnector: a Connector for TCP/IP network connectors, it is an interface which provides TCP/IP network 
connectors specific methods, such as open, close, getHost, getPort, etc.

2.2.3 Creates a number of threads "AbstractConnector$Acceptor" to accept client connection requests
jetty-io/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/io/AbstractConnector.java:
public abstract class AbstractConnector extends ContainerLifeCycle implements Connector, Dumpable {
 
    ...

    protected void doStart() throws Exception
    {
        _defaultConnectionFactory = getConnectionFactory(_defaultProtocol);
        if(_defaultConnectionFactory==null)
            throw new IllegalStateException("No protocol factory for default protocol: "+_defaultProtocol);

        super.doStart();

        _stopping=new CountDownLatch(_acceptors.length);
        for (int i = 0; i < _acceptors.length; i++)
            getExecutor().execute(new Acceptor(i));

        LOG.info("Started {}", this);
    }

    ...

    @Override
    protected void doStop() throws Exception
    {
        // Tell the acceptors we are stopping
        interruptAcceptors();

        // If we have a stop timeout
        long stopTimeout = getStopTimeout();
        if (stopTimeout > 0 && _stopping!=null)
            _stopping.await(stopTimeout,TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
        _stopping=null;

        super.doStop();

        LOG.info("Stopped {}", this);
    }
}
In doStart, a CountDownLatch "_stopping" is created for _acceptors.length number of threads, and in doStop, 
_stopping.await is called to wait for the Acceptors to complete. Actually only if the server is running, 
then while(isAccepting()) loop in AbstractConnector$Acceptor.run will not exit, so the Acceptor will not exit. 
That is, the acceptors will terminate only if the server is shutdown.
jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/AbstractConnector.java:
    private class Acceptor implements Runnable
    {
        private final int _acceptor;

        private Acceptor(int id)
        {
            _acceptor = id;
        }

        @Override
        public void run()
        {
            Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
            String name = current.getName();
            current.setName(name + "-acceptor-" + _acceptor + "-" + AbstractConnector.this);

            synchronized (AbstractConnector.this)
            {
                _acceptors[_acceptor] = current;
            }

            try
            {
                while (isAccepting())
                {
                    try
                    {
                        accept(_acceptor);
                    }
                    catch (Throwable e)
                    {
                        if (isAccepting())
                            LOG.warn(e);
                        else
                            LOG.debug(e);
                    }
                }
			}
			...
		}
	}
Method "accept" in AbstractConnector is an abstract method, server/ServerConnector overrides this "accept" method
to use ServerSocketChannel to accept client connections. It also override "open" in server/NetworkConnector which
performs the activities needed to open the network communication(for example, to start accepting incoming network
connections). AbstractNetworkConnector.doStart() calls open(), then super.doStart()(AbstractConnector.doStart()).
ServerConnector doesn't override method doStart(), so it inherits method doStart() from AbstractNetworkConnector.
ServerConnector overrides method open() in AbstractNetworkConnector and provides an implementation using 
ServerSocketChannel to handle connect requests. So ServerConnector.doStart() will call ServerConnector.open(), 
then AbstractNetworkConnector.doStart() which calls AbstractConnector.doStart(). AbstractConnector.doStart() 
creates a pool of threads acceptors of type Acceptor which calls accept to handle connect requests, 
while in AbstractConnector method accept is an abstract method, which is implemented in ServerConnector, that is 
why accept can use the ServerSocketChannel created and stored in private field "_acceptChannel" in ServerConnector.
AbstractConnector abstracts the work flow to handle connect requests, it is designed not to involve implementation 
details. So the implementation dependent operations, such as open and accept, are declared as abstract methods.
ServerConnector provides an implementation of these methods. ServerConnector.accept() is implemented as follows: 
jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ServerConnector.java:
    @Override
    public void accept(int acceptorID) throws IOException
    {
        ServerSocketChannel serverChannel = _acceptChannel;
        if (serverChannel != null && serverChannel.isOpen())
        {
            SocketChannel channel = serverChannel.accept();
            channel.configureBlocking(false);
            Socket socket = channel.socket();
            configure(socket);

            _manager.accept(channel);
        }
    }

2.2.4 Submit Runnable "Accept" for each socket channel.
When a client connection is accepted, a SocketChannel is ruturned. For each socket channel, we create a Runnable 
"Accept" for it, and submit it to one of ManagedSelectors as a change as follows:
jetty-io/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/io/SelectorManager.java:
    /**
     * <p>Registers a channel to perform non-blocking read/write operations.</p>
     * <p>This method is called just after a channel has been accepted by {@link ServerSocketChannel#accept()},
     * or just after having performed a blocking connect via {@link Socket#connect(SocketAddress, int)}.</p>
     *
     * @param channel the channel to register
     */
    public void accept(final SocketChannel channel)
    {
        final ManagedSelector selector = chooseSelector();
        selector.submit(selector.new Accept(channel));
    }

Sjetty-io/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/io/electorManager$ManagedSelector:
        /**
         * <p>Submits a change to be executed in the selector thread.</p>
         * <p>Changes may be submitted from any thread, and the selector thread woken up
         * (if necessary) to execute the change.</p>
         *
         * @param change the change to submit
         */
        public void submit(Runnable change)
        {
            // if we have been called by the selector thread we can directly run the change
            if (_thread==Thread.currentThread())
            {
                // If we are already iterating over the changes, just add this change to the list.
                // No race here because it is this thread that is iterating over the changes.
                if (_runningChanges)
                    _changes.offer(change);
                else
                {   
                    // Otherwise we run the queued changes
                    runChanges();
                    // and then directly run the passed change
                    runChange(change);
                }
            }
            else
            {
                // otherwise we have to queue the change and wakeup the selector
                _changes.offer(change);
                LOG.debug("Queued change {}", change);
                boolean wakeup = _needsWakeup;
                if (wakeup)
                    wakeup();
            }
        }
From the code snippet above, we know a Runnable "Accept" is submitted as a change to one of ManagedSelector, and 
it will be executed before ManagedSelector calls _selector.select() to process the selected socket channels.
jetty-io/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/io/SelectorManager$ManagedSelector:
        public void select()
        {
            boolean debug = LOG.isDebugEnabled();
            try
            {
                processChanges();

                if (debug)
                    LOG.debug("Selector loop waiting on select");
                int selected = _selector.select();
                if (debug)
                    LOG.debug("Selector loop woken up from select, {}/{} selected", selected, _selector.keys().size());

                _needsWakeup = false;

                Set<SelectionKey> selectedKeys = _selector.selectedKeys();
                for (SelectionKey key : selectedKeys)
                {
                    if (key.isValid())
                    {
                        processKey(key);
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        if (debug)
                            LOG.debug("Selector loop ignoring invalid key for channel {}", key.channel());
                        Object attachment = key.attachment();
                        if (attachment instanceof EndPoint)
                            ((EndPoint)attachment).close();
                    }
                }
                selectedKeys.clear();
            }
The Runnable "Accept" registers the socket channel with the ManagedSelector and attach a new EndPoint to key.
jetty-io/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/io/SelectorManager.java:
    /**
     * <p>Registers a channel to perform non-blocking read/write operations.</p>
     * <p>This method is called just after a channel has been accepted by {@link ServerSocketChannel#accept()},
     * or just after having performed a blocking connect via {@link Socket#connect(SocketAddress, int)}.</p>
     *
     * @param channel the channel to register
     */
    public void accept(final SocketChannel channel)
    {
        final ManagedSelector selector = chooseSelector();
        selector.submit(selector.new Accept(channel));
    }

    class Accept implements Runnable
    {
        private final SocketChannel _channel;

        public Accept(SocketChannel channel)
        {
            this._channel = channel;
        }

        @Override
        public void run()
        {
            try
            {
                SelectionKey key = _channel.register(_selector, 0, null);
                EndPoint endpoint = createEndPoint(_channel, key);
                key.attach(endpoint);
            }
            catch (IOException x)
            {
                LOG.debug(x);
            }
        }
    }

2.2.5 ManagedSelector calls select() to find out the socket channels that are signaled and process them        
When the SelectorManager is started, it creates several ManagedSelectors and start them. While each ManagedSelector 
calls select() repeatedly to find the client socket channels that are ready to accept connection or read/write.
Note SelectorManger is started once ServerConnector is started, since it is added as a bean to ServerConnector.
select() calls processChanges(), then processKey(SelectionKey) to process all the selected keys. processChanges 
will run all the Runnables submitted to the ManagedSelector as changes.
ProcessKey(SelectionKey) calls (SelectableChannelEndPoint)attachment.onSelected() to process the SelectionKey:
jetty-io/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/io/SelectorManager.java:
        @Override
        public void run()
        {
            _thread = Thread.currentThread();
            String name = _thread.getName();
            try
            {
                _thread.setName(name + "-selector-" + _id);
                LOG.debug("Starting {} on {}", _thread, this);
                while (isRunning())
                    select();
                processChanges();
            }
            finally
            {
                LOG.debug("Stopped {} on {}", _thread, this);
                _thread.setName(name);
            }
        }

        private void processKey(SelectionKey key)
        {
            Object attachment = key.attachment();
            try
            {
                if (attachment instanceof SelectableEndPoint)
                {
                    ((SelectableEndPoint)attachment).onSelected();
                }
                else if (key.isConnectable())
                {
                    processConnect(key, (Connect)attachment);
                }
                else
                {
                    throw new IllegalStateException();
                }
            }
		
			...

		}
Question: When SelectorManager.connect(...) will be called? In server side, no connect will be called, right?

2.2.6 Bound an EndPoint to a Connection
jetty-io/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/io/SelectorManager.java:
       private EndPoint createEndPoint(SocketChannel channel, SelectionKey selectionKey) throws IOException
        {
            EndPoint endPoint = newEndPoint(channel, this, selectionKey);
            endPointOpened(endPoint);
            Connection connection = newConnection(channel, endPoint, selectionKey.attachment());
            endPoint.setConnection(connection);
            connectionOpened(connection);
            LOG.debug("Created {}", endPoint);
            return endPoint;
        }

From the code snippet above, we know createEndPoint creates an EndPoint and Connection, and registers a read callback 
of the new Connection with the new EndPoint, this is how the new Connection is bound to the new EndPoint. 
Thus when a read/write I/O event is detected on SocketChannel, the associated EndPoint will get notified, the EndPoint 
then read data from the SocketChannel and progates it to the bound Connection.
Note:
createEndPoint(...) calls newEndPoint(...) which is an abstract method in SelectorManager to create an EndPoint.
The implementation of actual newEndPoint(...) used resides in ServerConnector$ServerConnectorManager which extends 
SelectorManager, it creates an SelectChannelEndPoint. Similarly ServerConnector$ServerConnectorManager creates
a new HttpConnection by calling its newConnection(...).
From the constructor of SeverConnector, we know the SelectorManager created is "ServerConnector$ServerConnectorManager":
jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ServerConnector.java:
    public ServerConnector(
        @Name("server") Server server,
        @Name("executor") Executor executor,
        @Name("scheduler") Scheduler scheduler,
        @Name("bufferPool") ByteBufferPool bufferPool,
        @Name("acceptors") int acceptors,
        @Name("selectors") int selectors,
        @Name("factories") ConnectionFactory... factories)
    {
        super(server,executor,scheduler,bufferPool,acceptors,factories);
        _manager = new ServerConnectorManager(getExecutor(), getScheduler(), selectors > 0 ? selectors : 
			Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());

        addBean(_manager, true);
    }

2.2.7 Read data from the socket channel when the read event it is waiting for has been detected
If the attachment is an instance of SelectableChannelEndPoint, the onSelected calllback is called, 
which means a read/write event is detected on the bound SocketChannel by the SelectorManager. 
We call (SelectableChannelEndPoint)attchment.onSelected() to process the read/write event.
jetty-io/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/io/SelectableChannelEndPoint.java:
    @Override
    public void onSelected()
    {
        assert _selector.isSelectorThread();
        int oldInterestOps = _key.interestOps();
        int readyOps = _key.readyOps();
        int newInterestOps = oldInterestOps & ~readyOps;
        setKeyInterests(oldInterestOps, newInterestOps);
        updateLocalInterests(readyOps, false);
        if (_key.isReadable())
            getFillInterest().fillable();
        if (_key.isWritable())
            getWriteFlusher().completeWrite();
    }
From the code snippet above, we know if the selected key "_key" is ready to read(_key.isReadable() returns true), 
AbstractEndPoint.getFillInterest() is called to get the FillInterest that is stored in private field "_fillInterest"
of AbstractEndPoint and calls the FillInterest.fillable(). 
While FillInterest.fillable() calls the read callback's onSucceed() which will calls HttpConnection.onFillable().
HttpConnection.onFillable() calls getEndPoint().fill(_requestBuffer) to read data from the associated SocketChannel
into _requestBuffer, then calls _parser.parseNext(_requestBuffer) to parse the data in _requestBuffer.

2.2.8 Wrap the data got from SocketChannel into a HttpRequest, and pass it to the corresponding service method of a Servlet.
HttpConnection's callback onFillable fills the request buffer using the data read from the corresponding SocketChannel by its
bound EndPoint, and calls HttpChannelOverHttp.run()(HttpChannelOverHttp inherits method run() from HttpChannel) which calls 
Server.handle(HttpChannel<?>) to handle the http request. 
And Server.handle(HttpChannel<?>) calls ServletContextHandler.doHandle() finally, the call chain is as follows:
Server.handle(HttpChannel) -> ScopedHandler.handle(String, Request, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) -> ContextHandler
.doHandle(String, Request, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse).
Note: From the sample code, we know the context handler set in Server is a ServletContextHandler. 
Server.handle(HttpChannel) actually calls ServletContextHandler.handle(String, Request, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)
which is inherited from ScopedHandler, and ScopedHandler.handle(String, Request, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) 
actually calls ServletContextHandler.doHandle(String, Request, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) which is inherited from 
ContextHandler. While ServletContextHandler wraps a ServletHandler which is created when ServletContextHandler.addServlet(...)
is called to add servlet-path mappings to the ServletContextHandler.
jetty-servlet/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/servlet/ServletContextHandler.java:
    /* ------------------------------------------------------------ */
    /** conveniance method to add a servlet.
     */
    public ServletHolder addServlet(String className,String pathSpec)
    {
        return getServletHandler().addServletWithMapping(className, pathSpec);
    }

    /* ------------------------------------------------------------ */
    /** conveniance method to add a servlet.
     */
    public ServletHolder addServlet(Class<? extends Servlet> servlet,String pathSpec)
    {
        return getServletHandler().addServletWithMapping(servlet.getName(), pathSpec);
    }

    /* ------------------------------------------------------------ */
    /**
     * @return Returns the servletHandler.
     */
    @ManagedAttribute(value="context servlet handler", readonly=true)
    public ServletHandler getServletHandler()
    {
        if (_servletHandler==null && !isStarted())
            _servletHandler=newServletHandler();
        return _servletHandler;
    }

    /* ------------------------------------------------------------ */
    protected ServletHandler newServletHandler()
    {
        return new ServletHandler();
    }

Questions: 
1) the _requestBuffer in HttpConnection is wrapped into _request in HttpChannel? If yes, how? 
2) How the Request is mapped to the corresponding Servlet???
ServletContextHandler should delegate request handling to its encapsulated ServletHandler, then the ServerletHandler will get 
the Servlet for the request by querying the path-ServletHolder mapping. But I don't know how the delegation is done???

HttpHandler(an interface in package "com.sun.net.httpserver" in jre API)

HttpParser.RequestHandler<T>

			|			/

ServletHandler	ContextHandler
					|
				ServletContextHandler

ContextHandler: This handler wraps a call to handle by setting the context and servlet path, plus setting the context classloader.
ServletHandler: This handler maps requests to servlets that implement the javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet API.
ServletContextHandler: This extension to ContextHandler allows for simple construction of a context with ServletHandler
and optionally session and security handlers, etc.

ServletContextHandler calls ServletHandler.doScoped(...) which calls ServletHandler.doHandle(...).
Note ServletContextHandler.addServlet(...) calls ServletHandler.addServletWithMapping(...).

2.2.9 Summary 
In summary, interface EndPoint is introduced to bridge the socket channel with the http connection. EndPoint's rule is to 
propogate the data got from its associated socket channel to HttpConnection, which can be depcited as follows:
			  events		  							data
SocketChannel	->	EndPoint(SelectableChannelEndPoint)	->	Connection(HttpConnection).
An instance of EndPoint is attached to a SelectionKey to achieve the propagation, which is the mechanism to interact with 
high-level protocol in java nio. The mechanism is stated in description of class SelectionKey as follows:
"It is often necessary to associate some application-specific data with a selection key, for example an object that 
represents the state of a high-level protocol and handles readiness notifications in order to implement that protocol. 
Selection keys therefore support the attachment of a single arbitrary object to a key. An object can be attached via the
attach method and then later retrieved via the attachment method." 
Interface Connection is an abstraction of all kinds of connections, such as SslConnection, HttpConnection, etc. 
Its convenient implementation AbstractConnection takes charges of the protocol independent tasks, such as registering a 
listener with a conneciton, interacting with the EndPoint, etc. And exposes some protocol dependent tasks, such as opening
a connection, registering a read callback with the bound end point, etc, as abstract methods. 
All the classes take charge of protocol independent tasks is in jetty-io/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/io.

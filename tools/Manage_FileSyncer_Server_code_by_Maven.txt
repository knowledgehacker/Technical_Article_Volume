						Manage FileSyncer Server code by Maven
							by minglin, 2013-03-28

You can get the FileSyncer Server code from github: git@github.com:knowledgehacker/FileSyncer.git

1. Setup a local repositories manager and tell Maven to retrieve repositories from local repositores manager
a. Setup Sonatype Nexus as the local repositories manager
Download Sonatype Nexus bundle from http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/go and unpack it in any directory as you like,
for example, "~/workspace/nexus-2.3.1-01".
cd ~/workspace/nexus-2.3.1-01
bin/nexus start
Then you can access to the Nexus server via webpage http://localhost:8081/nexus.
The dfault administrator user/password is "admin/admin123".
At this time, clicking "Views/Repositories -> Repositories" in the left side of the webpage, 
you can see a list of all the repositories Nexus knows about by default.
N.B. 1) To stop Nexus, execute "bin/nexus stop" in directory "nexus_directory". 
2) To change the address of your Nexus server, change "application-host" item in "nexus-2.3.1-01/conf/nexus.properties".

b.Create file settings.xml in directory "~/.m2", tell Maven to get repositories from local repositories manager
For an sample setting, please refer to file "settings.xml" in the same directory this article resides.

2. Manage FileSyncer Server code by Maven
1) Change the structure of sourcef files in directory "FileSyncer/http/server" to conform to Maven source code layout rule,
that is, create a "java" directory in "src/main".
And change the package name in each file, for example, change "package main.sync.server.http" to "package sync.server.http"
in "src/main/java/sync/server/http/HttpSyncServer.java".

2) Create file "pom.xml" in directory "FileSyncer/http/server".
Specify the project coordinate "groupId, artifactId, version", dependencies.
For detailed information, please refer to file "pom.xml" in "FileSyncer/http/server".

3. Add custom repositories for missing dependencies
If a repository your project depends on doesn't exist in the repositories list, you can add it by yourself.
For example, your project depends on jboss which doesn't exist in the repositories list by default,
you can find and add a Maven repository containing jboss as follows:
1) visit webpage "repository.jboss.org/nexus/index.html" and click "Views/Repositories -> Repositories" in the left side.
Select group "Public JBoss Repository Group", you can see the value of column "Repository Path" is 
"https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/jobss-public", which is the url of the repository we want.
2) switch back to your Nexus, Click "Add -> Proxy Repository" in the menu of repositories list, 
fill in all the information needed and click "Save" button, especially, fill "Remote Storage Location" with the url got in 1).
3) Add the settings of the new repository to ~/.m2/settings.xml as follows:
       <repository>
          <id>jboss public</id>
          <name>local private jboss</name>
          <url>http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/jboss</url>
          <releases><enabled>true</enabled></releases>
          <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
       </repository>
Note the url value "http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/jboss" comes from "Repository Path" column 
of the new repository "JBoss Public Repository".
4) Test the new repository
Add a dependency on the jboss to ~/workspace/FileSyncer/http/server/pom.xml as follows:
    <dependency>
      <groupId>jboss</groupId>
      <artifactId>jboss</artifactId>
      <version>4.2.1.GA</version>
    </dependency>
Then build FileSyncer server using "mvn package", you can see jboss-4.2.1.GA.jar is downloaded in the console output,
and you can double check it by looking into ~/.m2/respository to see whether a jboss directory exists or not.

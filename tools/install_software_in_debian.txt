E: Unable to locate package openjdk-7-jdk

2. Add mirror to "/etc/apt/sources.list"
The information above means package you want to install can't be found in the mirrors in /etc/apt/sources.list.
So you have to add the mirror containing the package to /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free
deb-src http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free

3. Update the indexing of the mirrors in "/etc/apt/source.list"
apt-get update

4. install using apt-get again
root@linming:~# apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
...

It works now!!!
